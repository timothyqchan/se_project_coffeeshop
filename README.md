# Practicum Coffee Shop

This is the second project of the Web Development program at Practicum. It was created using HTML and CSS, based on the design brief.

## Project features

- Semantic HTML5
- Flexbox
- Positioning
- Flat BEM
- iframe
- A custom form
- CSS animation and transform

## Plan on improving the project

- Stage 2:
- Right now the site looks bland with no hover effects or animations.
- I hope to soon be able to add those in.
